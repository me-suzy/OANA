Are you able to deny your own beliefs just because they are shared by someone else at some point?">

        <h2 class="text_obisnuit2"><em>If it is not in your power to be who you want to be, then find the strength to be someone other than you could&rsquo;ve been.</em></h2>
        <p class="text_obisnuit"><em>- Let me watch you. Looking at you, I feel like I&rsquo;m seeing my youth again. Tell me, what do you do? What have you been doing for so many bitter years? Where did you disappear when we never met? Come on, let&rsquo;s talk. I&rsquo;m inviting you to the fireplace.</em></p>
        <h3 class="text_obisnuit2">Leadership is the progress you make to earn that existence that transcends the boundaries of the ephemeral, without conditioning your existence on those experiences that need attention.</h3>
        <p class="text_obisnuit"><span class="text_obisnuit2">You Can Be The Leader</span> if you understood in the journey of your life what Alexandre Dumas expressed so wisely long ago. <em>&ldquo;Everything is found in the minuscule. The child is small, but within him is a man. The brain is narrow, but it shelters thought. The eye is only a point, but it embraces space.&rdquo;</em></p>
        <p class="text_obisnuit">Only a wise man can say these words.</p>
